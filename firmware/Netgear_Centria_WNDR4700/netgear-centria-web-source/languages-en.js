Port forwarding can typically be used to enable similar functionality, but it is static and has some limitations. </p><p>Port triggering opens an incoming port temporarily and does not require the server on the Internet to track your IP address if it is changed by DHCP, for example. </p><p>Port triggering monitors outbound traffic. When the router detects traffic on the specified outbound port, it remembers the IP address of the computer that sent the data and triggers the incoming port. Incoming traffic on the triggered port is then forwarded to the triggering computer.</p><p><a name=select></a>Using the Port Forwarding / Port Triggering screen, you can make local computers or servers available to the Internet for different services (for example, FTP or HTTP), to play Internet games (like Quake III), or to use Internet applications (like CU-SeeMe).</p><p>Port forwarding is designed for FTP, Web server, or other server-based services. Once port forwarding is set up, requests from the Internet are forwarded to the proper server. </p><p>Port triggering allows requests from the Internet only after a designated port is triggered. Port triggering applies to chat and Internet games.</p><hr><p><a name=pt_enable></a><b>Port Triggering</b></p><p>Note: If <b>Disable Port Triggering box</b> is checked, <b>all</b> port triggering function will be disabled but the configuration information will remain in the router.</p><p><a name=pt_timeout></a><b>Port Triggering Timeout</b></p><p>Enter a value up to 9999 minutes.

Port forwarding can typically be used to enable similar functionality, but it is static and has some limitations. </p><p>Port triggering opens an incoming port temporarily and does not require the server on the Internet to track your IP address if it is changed by DHCP, for example. </p><p>Port triggering monitors outbound traffic. When the router detects traffic on the specified outbound port, it remembers the IP address of the computer that sent the data and triggers the incoming port. Incoming traffic on the triggered port is then forwarded to the triggering computer.</p><p><a name=select></a>Using the Port Forwarding / Port Triggering screen, you can make local computers or servers available to the Internet for different services (for example, FTP or HTTP), to play Internet games (like Quake III), or to use Internet applications (like CU-SeeMe).</p><p>Port forwarding is designed for FTP, Web server, or other server-based services. Once port forwarding is set up, requests from the Internet are forwarded to the proper server. </p><p>The internal port range field must match the external port range field in these respects:</p> <ul><li>Both fields must have the same number of port ranges </li><li>Each port range in the internal port range field must have the same number of ports as its corresponding set in external port range field. </li></ul><p>For example, if you specify 30-50, 78, 100-102 in the External port range field, then 40-60, 99, 200-202 is one possible legal setting for the Internal port range field because it meets both criteria. However, 40-50, 200-202 is an illegal setting for the Internal port range field for two reasons:</p> <ul><li>Does not have the same number of port ranges (External port range field has three ranges, the illegal example has only two ranges)</li> <li>Each port range field does not have the same number of ports as its corresponding set in the External port range field (the illegal Internal port range field example.s first set has only 10 ports, while the External port range field set has 20 ports).</li></ul><p>Port triggering allows requests from the Internet only after a designated port is triggered. Port triggering applies to chat and Internet games.</p><hr><p><b>Port Forwarding</b></p><p>For the services, applications, or games that already exist in the drop-down list, you need to specify only the computer's IP address.

Also, you need to have the IP address for the computer that you want to use.</p><p>To set up a computer to play Internet games or use Internet applications:<ol><li>Select the Internet application or game you want to use from one of the relevant lists. <br>The <b>Start Port</b> and <b>End Port</b> fields are filled in. <br><b>Note: </b>If you cannot find the game or application you want in one of the lists, click the <b>Add Custom Service</b> button, and enter the service name, starting port, ending port, and server IP address. </li> <li>Type the IP address of the computer in the <b>Server IP Address</b> field. </li> <li>Click <b>Add</b>. </li></ol><p>To set up an additional computer to play, for example, Hexen II or KALI:<ol> <li> Click the <b>Add Custom Service</b> button.</li> <li>Type the service name in the <b>Service Name </b> field.</li> <li>Type the beginning port number in the<b> Starting Port</b> field. <br>For these games, use the default number, and add 1 for each additional computer.
